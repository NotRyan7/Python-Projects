# Digit Recognizer: CNN Accuracy 99.12%

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The CNN architecture is designed to recognize and categorize digits from 0 to 9 with high accuracy.

## Key Features:
- **Data**: MNIST dataset containing 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits.
- **Model**: CNN with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
- **Performance**: Achieves high classification accuracy and is optimized through training and validation.

The project includes scripts for training the model, evaluating performance, and generating predictions for new data.
